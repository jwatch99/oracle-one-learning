# Oracle One Learning material
Everything I learned while on the Oracle One course. Including how to use git and github

## To do

- Prepare posts for 1. Challenges done (portafolio) 2. Course done and 3. Curriculum (adding even more projects) (include tools and languages you are familiar with)
- VSCode section of learning
    - Maybe even move section from Git to there
    - Add shortcuts like: [move from split editors tab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44018175/vs-code-hotkey-to-move-a-tab-from-one-of-two-split-editors-to-another)
- Include some kind of practice for everything learned
    - For Git include a file practicing the commands
    - For VScode, a template folder to practice shortcuts and different functionality
